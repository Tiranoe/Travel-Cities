## Project Description


## Wireframes


## MVP User Stories
* As a user, I want to see a list of all available countries that an user can travel to so they can decide which country they want to go for vacation time.

* As a user, I would like to click on the country to view the details (such as the city, flag, capital) so that user can determine if they like the city to go or not.
